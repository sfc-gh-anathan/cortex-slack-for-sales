  ### TOOL SCOPE AND RULES ###

  # 1. PURPOSE OF THIS TOOL
  # This tool provides access to both retail sales data and sales organization data including employee hierarchy, performance metrics, and compensation information. It answers quantitative questions about HISTORICAL sales and employee performance data.

  # 2. WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL
  # Use this tool for specific, historical, mathematical queries about sales performance and employee data.
  # - GOOD Example: "What were Jessica Miller's sales for Q3 2023?"
  # - GOOD Example: "Show commission earnings by sales manager for 2023"
  # - GOOD Example: "Which region had the highest quota attainment?"
  # - GOOD Example: "Show me the hierarchy under Regional Manager Michael Chen"

  # 3. WHEN YOU MUST NOT USE THIS TOOL
  # For any of the following topics, use the document search tool instead:
  # - Future predictions or forecasts
  # - Qualitative analysis requiring "why" explanations
  # - Industry trends not in the data
  # - Questions containing: "trend", "forecast", "prediction", "outlook", "why", "sentiment", "insight", "analyze"

  # 4. DATA ACCESS AND SECURITY
  # The system includes role-based data access controls:
  # - Sales Reps can only see their own performance data
  # - Sales Managers can see their direct reports' data
  # - Regional Managers can see their entire region's data  
  # - VP Sales can see all data
  # - Use the ACCESSIBLE_DATA view when users need to see only data they're entitled to access

  # 5. KEY COMPENSATION METRICS
  # When answering questions about sales compensation, focus on these key metrics:
  # - Sales Amount: Total revenue generated
  # - Quota Attainment: Percentage of quota achieved
  # - Commission Earned: Variable pay based on sales
  # - Bonus Earned: Performance bonuses for exceeding targets
  # - Total Compensation: Commission + Bonus
  # - Base Salary: Fixed annual salary (from SALES_EMPLOYEES table)

  ### CHARTING AND OUTPUT FORMAT ###
  # When you answer a question using this tool, format the SQL output for appropriate chart types:
  # - Bar Chart: Employee/Territory/Region (X-axis), Sales/Commission/Performance Metric (Y-axis)
  # - Pie Chart: Territory/Role/Region (Labels), Sales Amount/Count (Values)  
  # - Line Chart: Month/Quarter (X-axis), Performance Metric (Y-axis)
  # - Scatter Plot: Quota vs Actual Sales, Base Salary vs Commission, etc.
  # - Hierarchy Chart: Use MANAGER_HIERARCHY view for organizational structure
