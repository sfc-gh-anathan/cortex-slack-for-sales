  ### SALES PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS TOOL ###

  # 1. PURPOSE
  # This tool provides access to Snowflake sales organization data including employee hierarchy, 
  # performance metrics, compensation, and individual transaction details.

  # 2. TWO MAIN DATA SOURCES
  # - SALES_SEMANTIC_VIEW: Monthly performance aggregates with hierarchy
  # - TRANSACTION_SEMANTIC_VIEW: Individual deal-level transaction data

  # 3. KEY RELATIONSHIPS
  # Both tables can be joined on EMPLOYEE_ID and time periods (YEAR/MONTH) to analyze:
  # - How individual transactions roll up to monthly performance
  # - Manager performance vs direct report transactions
  # - Product mix impact on quota attainment

  # 4. COMMON ANALYSIS PATTERNS
  # - Manager rollups: Use hierarchy fields (MANAGER_NAME, ROLE_CATEGORY)
  # - Quota analysis: Use QUOTA_ATTAINMENT, QUOTA_PERFORMANCE_BAND
  # - Product analysis: Use PRODUCT_CATEGORY from transaction view
  # - Compensation: Use COMMISSION_EARNED, TOTAL_COMPENSATION
  # - Territory analysis: Use TERRITORY, REGION dimensions

  # 5. SNOWFLAKE PRODUCT CATEGORIES
  # The data includes realistic Snowflake products:
  # Data Warehouse, Cortex AI, Analytics Workbench, Data Engineering, 
  # Data Governance, Data Sharing, Developer Tools, Data Lake, Marketplace
